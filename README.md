# Voice Recognition 
---
The goal of the project is to prepare a machine learning module that can be hypothetically used in an automated, voice-based intercom device. Imagine that you are working in a team of several programmers and the access to your floor is restricted with doors. There is an intercom that can be used to open the door. You are implementing a machine learning module that will recognize if a given person has the permission to open the door or not.
